Welcome to my homepage! 

I am Ruishuo Chen (陈睿硕 in Chinese), an incoming M.Sc. student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I will be honored to work under the supervision of Professor [Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/index.html) starting in Fall 2025.

I graduated from [Suzhou High School of Jiangsu Province](https://www.szzx1000.cn/) and am currently completing my B.Sc. in Statistics at the [School of Mathematics, Nanjing University](https://math.nju.edu.cn/) (expected graduation June 2025).

My research is primarily focused on AI-driven Decision Making, with current interests including:
- Reinforcement Learning (RL) 
- Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets).
