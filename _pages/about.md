Welcome to my homepage! 

I am Ruishuo Chen (陈睿硕 in Chinese), a first-year M.Sc. student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I am fortunate to work under the supervision of Professor [Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/index.html).

I received my B.Sc. in Statistics from the [School of Mathematics, Nanjing University](https://math.nju.edu.cn/) in 2025. I am also a graduate of [Suzhou High School of Jiangsu Province](https://www.szzx1000.cn/).

My research is primarily focused on AI-driven Decision Making, with current interests including:
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
